I taught undergraduate year abroad students tutorials on the **Politics of Russia and the Former Soviety Union**,covering the regionâ€™s political evolution from the late Soviet period to contemporary developments in Russia and neighboring states.

Topics included:
- State-building and democratisation in post-Soviet countries  
- Authoritarian consolidation under Putin  
- Civil society and protest movements
